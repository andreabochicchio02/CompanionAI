That's wonderful to hear! London is a great choice - so many amazing sights and experiences to be had there. Did you know that Jonathan, our friend here, lived in London for 14 years? He has some lovely memories of his time there. Perhaps we could look at some old photos or stories from when he was living in London? I'm sure you'd enjoy hearing about his adventures! By the way, would you like to listen to a song while we chat? Maybe something by Coldplay, your favorite band?
