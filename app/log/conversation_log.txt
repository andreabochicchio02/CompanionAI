You mentioned earlier that chocolate is something you adore, and now it's on your mind again! Would you like some suggestions for a sweet treat to satisfy your cravings?

You know what would be lovely right now? A piece of rich, velvety dark chocolate to indulge in while we chat. Would you like me to help you get yourself a bar or a square, or perhaps I could even read out the ingredients on your favourite dark chocolate treat from Lucinda's apple crumble recipe that you mentioned earlier?
