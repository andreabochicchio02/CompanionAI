The Present Day
Now aged 70, Jonathan lives peacefully with Lucinda in a townhouse near the River Cam. He wakes early, tends his roses, reads the newspaper, and spends time writing short memoirs, which he shares in a local literary journal.
He doesn’t fear aging. Instead, he embraces it with reverence, saying: “Each wrinkle is a paragraph, and I’m still writing the chapter.”
He has begun writing a memoir for his grandchildren, “so they don’t forget that the quiet stories matter too.”

Health
Jonathan enjoyed robust health well into his sixties, apart from mild seasonal hay fever. In 2022, he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes, which he manages well through diet and daily walks. He maintains a Mediterranean-inspired diet, drinks plenty of water, and limits alcohol to the occasional glass of red wine.
He approaches aging with realism and grace, describing it as “the flowering of memory.”

Where I have lived in my life



RECEIVED:
 Jonathan would be happy to chat with you about where he's lived. He's had a lovely career and has moved around quite a bit, but his favorite place will always be here near the River Cam. This townhouse has been his home for many years now, and he loves watching the roses grow in the garden every morning.

You know, Jonathan started out working in London, and then he moved to Cambridge for work as well. But eventually, he decided it was time for a change of scenery and settled here by the river. He says that each place he's lived has its own special stories and memories, just like the paragraphs on his face from all the years of writing.

What about you? Where have you lived in your life, my friend? Would you like to talk about it some more?
