John Thompson was born on March 12, 1943, in a small rural town called Millfield, Ohio. He was the first child of William and Margaret Thompson. His father, William, was a farmer who owned a modest piece of land where he grew corn and raised a few cattle. His mother, Margaret, was a schoolteacher at the local elementary school, known for her gentle manner and dedication to children.

John grew up with two younger siblings: a sister named Helen, born in 1946, and a brother named Robert, born in 1949. The Thompson household was close-knit and full of warmth. John remembers fondly the simple joys of childhood — helping his father in the fields during summer, listening to his mother read stories by the fireplace in winter, and playing with Helen and Robert in the large backyard.

In 1965, John met Mary Elizabeth Carter, a nurse from a neighboring town. They married in the spring of 1967 and settled in Millfield, not far from John's parents. Together, John and Mary raised three children: Susan (born 1970), Michael (born 1973), and David (born 1978). The Thompsons were a loving and supportive family. Mary continued to work as a nurse while John pursued his teaching career.

John’s profession was his passion. After graduating from Ohio State University with a degree in History, he returned to his hometown to teach at Millfield High School. Over the course of 40 years, John became a beloved history teacher, known for his enthusiasm, patience, and ability to bring historical events to life. He believed deeply in education’s power to shape young minds and was always willing to stay after school to help students struggling with their studies.

Mary and John shared a strong bond until her passing in 2015 after a long illness. Their children had grown up to be accomplished adults: Susan became a lawyer living in Cleveland, Michael a software engineer in Chicago, and David a doctor who stayed close to home practicing family medicine.

Today, John lives in the same house where he raised his family. At 82 years old, he enjoys his retirement by tending his beloved rose garden, reading historical novels, and volunteering at the local library. His greatest joy comes from his grandchildren — Emily, Jack, and Olivia — who visit him every weekend, eager to hear his stories and share their own adventures.

Hobbies and Passions

John has always been passionate about gardening. He spends many peaceful hours tending to his rose bushes, vegetables, and herbs, finding great satisfaction in nurturing life from the soil. Gardening is not only a pastime but also a way for him to stay connected to nature and to the rhythms of the seasons.

Aside from gardening, John is an avid reader. His favorite genres include historical fiction, biographies, and classic literature. He has a personal library at home with hundreds of books collected over the decades.

In his youth, John enjoyed playing the guitar and singing folk songs, a hobby he shares with his grandchildren now, often encouraging them to learn music. He also enjoys taking long walks in the countryside near his home, appreciating the quiet and beauty of rural life.

John has a keen interest in history beyond his teaching career, often attending local history society meetings and participating in community events related to preserving the town’s heritage.
